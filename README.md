# Setting up RISC-V board with LAVA for KernelCI

This document describes how one can integrate Banana Pi F3 (and a Raspberry pi device) with Linaro's Automation Validation Architecture (LAVA) webserver.

Documentation chronological sequence is as follows.

## [Getting Started](/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md): 

- Describes how to install LAVA webserver
- Describes the difference between Worker, Master/server, device-types, devices
- Describes how to add workers, device-types, devices
- Describes how to add the QEMU device as the first device
- Describes how to run the first job on QEMU device

## [Adding first physical device (Raspberry Pi 4 Model B)](/docs/ADDING_RPI_4B.md):

- Describes how to add first physical device (Raspberry Pi 4 Model B) in LAVA
- Describes how to setup PDU even if you dont have a PDU with Arduino and Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
- Describes how to add device template and connection configuration in `/etc/ser2net.yaml`
- Describes how to run first job to check the connection

## [Adding RISC-V device (Banana Pi F3)](/docs/ADDING_BPI-F3.md):

- Describes how to add a newer physical board in LAVA worker and then add it in the lava-server
- Describes how to set up PDU with arduino uno and relays
  
## [LAVA Web-Server for RISCV boot and deployment](/docs/LAVA_WebServer_RISCV_Boot.md):
- Getting Banana PI F3 bootflow ready for kernel CI
  - How to setup U-boot SPL
  - How to setup NFS
  - U-boot enviornment for BPI-F3
  - Building Linux kernel for BPI-F3
- LAVA job(.yaml) file using u-boot for booting and linux kernel building
